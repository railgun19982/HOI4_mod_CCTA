China Communism Transitional Alliance

This world line shows us the world line after the KMT Left Party succeeded in seizing power. Under the KMT Left Party's policy of "uniting with Russia, the Communist Party, and helping farmers and workers" and Jiang Baili's military system, China's Anti Japanese War soon united all forces that could be united, including Soviet Russia and the Comintern. On January 25, 1925, the "young servicemen's society" was established in Huangpu Military Academy. In June of the same year, in Pingding During Liu Zhenhuan's rebellion, a commander named Chiang Kai Shek was bombed to death. With the support of Borodin, the left wing of the Kuomintang led by Liao Zhongkai grew rapidly, and then launched the "January 16" coup. The right wing, including the "Gang of three", were either killed or imprisoned. So in this dramatic history, China first had a more unified structure in ideology, and then, relying on Bukharin's armaments, Marx's theory, and the perseverance of the Chinese people, began the protracted war of resistance against Japan. On May 9, 1943, the 18th army, which was reorganized from the former Zhu Mao Red Army, drove out Heixiazi Island, the last piece of land occupied by the Japanese. Let the rising sun flag freeze over the cold Siberia

However, the rapid development of China's Anti Japanese War attracted the attention of all countries in the world. In 1932, the Soviet Communist Party faction headed by Bukharin had just settled down in the center of the Soviet Communist Party, and then turned its eyes to the Far East. With the influx of Anti Japanese war materials from the Soviet Union, the confidence of the Chinese people has been growing. After Japan lost Manchuria and Korea one after another, Japan and China began to face each other across the sea. However, in Japan, the huge military expenditure increased out of thin air due to the confrontation with the Chinese Army led to a surge of domestic undercurrent

1965

Twenty years later, the Japanese people finally tasted the fruits of victory in the arduous revolution, and the people's Republic of Japan was declared.

Bukharin's economic policy made the Soviet army have no power to fight back against Nazi Germany. Germany occupied all the Soviet territory except southeast Siberia, but Hitler's death made the sectarian undercurrent surging inside Nazi Germany, and everyone wanted to seize the result.

After the painful reform, the Chinese established a market economy and planned to gradually transition to primary socialism by 2020, but there were differences in the party: the right wing of the new Kuomintang advocated the transition to capitalism and directly fought against the left wing. The new rightists are strongly supported by market capital, and they are powerful enough to tear the whole country apart.
